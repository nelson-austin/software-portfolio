# Overview

I created a weather service app. You can view current temperatures for different cities and also opt to view a 5 day forecast. Data is pulled from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/).

# Development Environment

* Code editor - Visual Studio Code
* OpenWeatherApi
* Programming Languages - HTML, CSS, JS

# Useful Websites

* [Open Weather Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [Getting Started](https://openweathermap.org/appid)

# Future Work

* Save city names between pages so that the user doesn't have to search for cities twice
* Sace cities in the overview section - doesn't auto clear each time they leave the page
* Show more detailed weather information
* Add day names to the daily forecast
