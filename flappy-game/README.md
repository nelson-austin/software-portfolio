# Overview

I made flappy bird! Flappy bird is an arcade-style, side-scrolling game where a player controls a bird through pipes with gaps of varying heights. Goal is to get as far as you can! Control the bird with your space bar.
This game runs on Pygame (open-source Python library for writing video games).
